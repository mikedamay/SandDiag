Sandcastle/SHFB does not fully support tuples:
VS 2017 (2)
Sandcastle/SHFB v2018.5.29.0
Sandcastle project using Framework Version - Cross Platform (Net Core/Net Standard)
Target assembly project using Target Framework - .NET Core 2.1
In the following example:

namespace SandDiag
{
    /// <summary>
    /// summary of IFoo
    /// </summary>
    public interface IFoo
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// summary of Bar
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="someTuple">s/be an int and a string</param>
        void Bar((int, string) someTuple);
        /// <summary>
        /// summary of Qux
        /// </summary>
        /// <returns>s/be a (int, string) or a ValueTuple&lt;int, string></returns>
        (int, string) Qux();
    }
}

references to tuples are corrupted on the SHFB generated documentation as below:

void Bar(
	(int , string , ) someTuple
)
Parameters
someTuple
Type: System.ValueTuple<Int32, String>

(int , string , , , T1 , T2 ,  ,  ) Qux()
Return Value
Type: ValueTuple<Int32, String>

In the case of the parameter an otiose trailing comma appears in the signature.  In the case of
the return value there are multiple extra commas and type parameters in the signature.

I could actually live with all of that but in my actual project the documentation of a method
with a tuple return type is completely corrupted but I could not replicate it in a simple
example and am hoping if we can fix this simple problem this will solve the complex one.

The simple testcase project is at github.com/mikedamay/SandDiag.

I am happy to help in fixing this.  Unfortunately I did not get off to a good start as I had
problems installing the SHFB project with community edition.
